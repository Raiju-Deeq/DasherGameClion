# Dasher Game

Welcome to the **Dasher Game** repository! This project is part of my journey to learn the C++ programming language while building a fun and interactive game.

## About the Project

This game is being developed using the **CLion IDE** and serves as a hands-on approach to mastering C++ concepts. The code is currently in a rough state, but I plan to refactor and improve it over the summer.

## Features (Planned)

- Engaging gameplay mechanics
- Clean and modular C++ code
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Getting Started
